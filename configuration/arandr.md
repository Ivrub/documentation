# Screen Layout Editor

The Screen Layout Editor (`arandr` from the command line) is a graphical tool for selection display modes, and setting up multiple displays.

The editor can be found on the Preferences menu, but the entry will only be present if the 3D graphics driver is being used as it is this driver that provides the requried mode setting functionality.

On the whole the usage of the editor is self explanatory. Use the Configure menu option to select the screen, resolution and orientation. You can drag around the displays in a multi screen setup to any position using the mouse. When you have the required setup, press the Tick button to apply those settings.
